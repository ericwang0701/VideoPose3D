Next, download the pretrained model for generating 3D predictions. This model is different than the pretrained ones listed in the main README, as it expects input keypoints in COCO format (generated by the pretrained Detectron model) and outputs 3D joint positions in Human3.6M format. Put this model in the checkpoint directory of this repo.
